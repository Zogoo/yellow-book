# Regression guard for a class of bug that ordinary request specs miss.
#
# `post ..., params: {...}` sends form-encoded data. Real clients send
# `Content-Type: application/json`, which goes through ActionDispatch's
# parameter parser and `ActiveSupport::JSON.decode`. Those are different code
# paths, and a break in the JSON one takes down every real request while a
# form-encoded suite stays green.
#
# This happened: json 3.0 made `JSON.parse` keyword-only while ActiveSupport
# still passed its options hash positionally, so under Ruby 3.4 the API
# returned 400 for everything. The Gemfile pins json to 2.x; these examples
# make sure the parser is actually exercised.
